## oneAPI Intel Optimized Scikit Learn SN1 reaction prediction

provides a comprehensive example of how to use RDKit for cheminformatics tasks, alongside Scikit-learn for machine learning, specifically designed to predict SN1 reaction likelihoods based on molecular descriptors. Here's a breakdown of the code's functionality:

Generate Synthetic Data: The function generate_synthetic_data creates a set of synthetic molecules by combining a list of base molecules (defined by their SMILES notation) with a set of functional groups. For each generated molecule, it checks the validity using RDKit, calculates two molecular descriptors (molecular weight and logP), and assigns a random binary outcome (0 or 1) representing whether the molecule is likely to undergo an SN1 reaction. This data is then compiled into a pandas DataFrame.

Train Model: The train_model function takes the generated DataFrame as input and trains a RandomForestClassifier from Scikit-learn to predict the SN1 reaction likelihood based on the molecular weight and logP descriptors. This model can then be used to predict the reaction likelihood for new molecules.

Calculate Descriptors: The calculate_descriptors function computes the molecular weight and logP for a given molecule (specified by its SMILES notation). These descriptors are crucial for the model to make predictions.

Visualize Molecule: Using RDKit's drawing capabilities, the visualize_molecule function generates an image of the molecule from its SMILES string and displays it within the Jupyter Notebook. This visual aid helps in understanding the structure of the molecule being analyzed.

Interactive Input and Prediction: The notebook utilizes IPython widgets (via interact) to create an interactive text input for entering SMILES strings. When a SMILES string is entered, the notebook:

Calculates and displays the molecular weight and logP.
Visualizes the molecule.
Uses the previously trained RandomForestClassifier to predict whether the molecule is likely to undergo an SN1 reaction based on its descriptors.
Workflow Integration: Upon execution, the notebook automatically generates synthetic data and trains the RandomForestClassifier. This setup ensures that the model is ready for making predictions right away. Users can then input different SMILES strings to evaluate other molecules.
